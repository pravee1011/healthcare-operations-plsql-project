# Healthcare Management System – Oracle PL/SQL Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **Healthcare Management System** built using **Oracle PL/SQL**, designed to simulate real-world hospital and clinic database operations.  
It focuses on appointment scheduling, billing management, and maintaining patient medical records through a single, well-structured PL/SQL package.

The project demonstrates how business logic can be centralized at the database layer using **packages, collections, and bulk processing techniques**.

---

## Why This Project
- Reflects **real-world healthcare workflows** commonly handled in enterprise systems
- Demonstrates **advanced PL/SQL concepts** beyond basic CRUD operations
- Shows how database logic can be made **modular, reusable, and scalable**
- Emphasizes **performance optimization** using BULK COLLECT and FORALL
- Designed with **interview discussion and practical understanding** in mind

---

## Technologies Used
- Oracle Database
- Oracle PL/SQL
- SQL Developer / SQL*Plus

## Database Objects Used
- Packages
- Records and Collections
- Bulk Collect and FORALL
- Exception handling
- Insert with RETURNING clause

## Package: healthcare_ops

### Function: compute_doctor_load
Returns number of appointments for a doctor between two dates.

### Procedure: schedule_appointment
- Schedules an appointment
- Automatically creates a billing record
- Handles cancelled appointments

### Procedure: get_patient_history
- Fetches patient medical history
- Uses BULK COLLECT into a collection

### Procedure: bulk_add_med_records
- Inserts multiple medical records at once
- Uses FORALL for performance

## Purpose of the project:
Designed to demonstrate real-world healthcare scenarios using PL/SQL best practices.
